**This repo is supposed to be used as config by NvChad users!**

- The main nvchad repo [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules , like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)
